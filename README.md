This is a Solver for Quadratic Spline Interpolation, Polynomial Regression, and Simplex Minimization which is made as a requirement fro CMSC150 (Numerical and Symbolic Computation)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Dependencies

The application requires the following installed for development:

* `NodeJS` framework (version 10.13.0 above)
* `flask` library (version 1.0.2)
* `yarn` CLI (optional, version 1.12.3)

Clone the [application](https://github.com/jasarqui/150-Solver-and-Optimizer) and then run `npm install` or `yarn add`. This will set up the remaining dependencies needed by the application to run.

## Development

When developing the app, open two terminals that will open the cloned folder. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the web app, and `npm flask-start` or `yarn flask-start` to start the solver modules. Once the application loads, you can start developing.

It is also important to note that everytime you make a change to the code of the application, `create-react-app` already has a module that updates itself through `react-scripts` so you get all the new updates automatically.


## File Structure

The folders are implemented as follows (once all dependencies have been installed):
